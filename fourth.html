						I would work Information desk; this is where I would refer people to resources for their research or answer just general questions.</p></td>

						<td><p>Alongside my fellow research members, I am working on creating a website for a design challenge. The design challenge
						utilizes participatory methods to teach students HCDE components and allows them to contribute their own design ideas for 
						the social robot. This website, while considering what attracts teens, will provide the necessary information about the design challenge. 
						My job consists of researching about teens, contributing to the information architecture, and ensuring the deployment of the website.</p></td>
